Prototype for Color Of World

-Bring/Convert the whole world map into circle color palettes.
-Each street/city will be seperated by color.
-Geo Elevation data to have the color palettes have its own lat/lon height match to the real world elevation.
-Color search from street view to collect colors.
-Convert the collected colors into an image.

[More things to be worked on]
Searchng image with collected colors is not dynamic right now. It is static. (gotta switch this into google image search API)
Right now, It only visualize San Francisco but it will eventually get multiples citys.
