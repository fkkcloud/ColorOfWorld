Infographic of how it is going to work

ScreenShot Illustraction (temporarily design)

1. User Explore the world with hand gesture (using Leap Motion)
2. User find an interesting location and lock the map to scan it
3. From the 5 location points from user's finger (it can be less than 5 just in case), program gets 5 different set of Logitude and Latitude of the current map as parameter
4. 5 different location( Longitude , Latitude )'s 5 different street view images are loaded and evaluate to export 5 different palettes based on the picture's color wheel.
5. Those 5 different color palettes will be used to run a simulation to get 1 drawing that has most-matched color palette.
