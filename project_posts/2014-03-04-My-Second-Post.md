1. User Explore the world with hand gesture (using Leap Motion)
2. User find an interesting location and lock the map to scan it
3. From the 5 location points from user's finger pointing (it can be less than 5 just in case), program gets 5 different set of Logitude and Latitude
4. 5 different location( Longitude , Latitude )'s 5 different street view images will be loaded and evaluated to export 5 different palettes based on the picture's color information.
5. Those 5 different color palettes will be used to run a simulation to find 1 drawing from classical masterpiece library that has most-matched color palette to the collected color palettes.
