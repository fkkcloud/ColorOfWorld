I was always passionated in exploring something. Learning and research something new and unknown is most important thing to make my everyday living creative. Now with the powerful network service around us, it is getting more easier and easier to get resources of diffent interests that I can't acheive instantly. What if I can get a color pallette of a place where opposite side of earth from where I am standing? Exploring the color palettes of different places of earth. Based on the color palettes of five fingers, with leap motion and google maps api will help us to get the places's logitude, latitude and even street view images. Those datas(Color palettes) will be used to find best-matched one of the legendary masterpieces from old ages.
