## Description
I was always passionated in exploring something. Learning and research something new unknown is most important thing to make my everyday living creative. Now with the powerful network service that connects everything to everything among us, it is getting easier and easier to get resources of diffent interests that was almost impossible to obtain instantly. 

What if I can get a color pallette of a place where opposite side of earth from where I am standing? 

Exploring the color palettes of different places of earth. Based on information from what five fingers are pointing to map using Leap Motion, it will give us exact map/streed view and location information (longitude, latitude) of the place. Google maps api will help us to get the places's street view images and the image will be evaluated to export a color palette. Those palettes will be used to find one of the legendary masterpieces from old ages that has best-matched color palettes to our collected color palettes from the world-wide map!
