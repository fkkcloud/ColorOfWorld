## Description
Learning and research something new unknown is most important thing to make everyday living creative. 
Now with the powerful network service that connects everything to everything among us, it is getting easier and easier to get resources of different interests that was almost impossible to obtain instantly. 

What if we can get a color pallette of a place where opposite side of earth from where I am standing? 

Exploring the color palettes of different places of earth. Based on information from what five fingers are pointing to map using Leap Motion, it will give us exact map/street view and location information (longitude, latitude) of the place. Google maps api will help us to get the places's street view images and the image will be evaluated to export a color palette. Those palettes will be used to find / connect / interact and create an art with our collected color palettes from the world-wide map!
